The library is stocked with early childrenâ??s books (infant â?? Pre-K). The unveiling ceremony was a chance to build excitement around books and to launch our successful Books for Africa fundraiser which allowed us to donate a LFL to a community in Africa. The library has been a tremendous success, with children visiting daily on their way to and from school. The children are excited to swap books with each other. Our hope is to build a stronger sense of community as we share books with the College Heights community and with a community in Africa. At the unveiling, Mr. Matt led the children in the \"Community Song\" which includes the lyric \"It's love that builds community.\" Matt Donald, \"Mr.Matt\", parent of Ethan, built and donated a Little Free Library to the Parent Teacher Association Silent Auction school fundraiser. Bill Dawson and Julie Carroll, parents of Charlotte, purchased the Little Free Library and donated it back to the school. Principal Suzanne Kennedy and School Librarian Karen Collins supported the LFL and helped organize the Books for Africa fundraiser.
